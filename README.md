## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 


"Seagulls of Wellington"


This code creates paramerterised seagulls that are constantly randomized to produce new an interesting characters. Different types off random are used to create different rarity in the randomness. Some traits in the seagulls are more common. You can ajust the sliders in the editor to see what each of the variables do. In the arrangement they are all put together on a randomly offset grid where all of there different traits are shown off. 

The design for this code was inpired by artist DSIDE who graffitied a mored WW2 era tug boat in wellington that has since been sunk. 


Summary of parameters:
Body(Width, height and roundness)
Beak lenght
seagull colour
beak colour
eye colour
eye size
eyebrow size
different types of eyebrows
eyebrow rotation
Pupil location
hair
eye location

Everything about the seagull has been parameterised. This is so that there are no parts of the seagull that will look the same across the design. When the same shape is picked up by the eye you will instantly form a pattern and will link all the seagulls together. Because everything is parameterised the seagulls feel more natural and organic.
